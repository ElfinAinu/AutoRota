Hard Rules:
No one works more than 6 days in a row. If someone does, it's rare and only if absolutely required.
Rota runs Sunday to Saturday - when accounting for weekends, sat/sun are to be considered. There Will be crossover between weeks.
Individual requirements must be followed.
Anything in Rules must be applied without fail.
Individual preferences are aimed for, with weighting a reward for any deviations.
Everyone gets one full weekend off over the course of the Rota.
Everyone should have a distribution of weekend days off equally - minimise favouritsm.
Days off should be kept together and not separated as best as possible.
Employees-duty_manager-reserve are to be used only if required to meet requirements of duty_managers.
